* Configurations
  Configuration settings are done using env vars. You can source =.envrc= or 
 use [[https://github.com/direnv/direnv][direnv]].
 
* Steps
1. Boot Raspbian up, run =raspi-config=, change it to boot to the console instead of X, change the GPU memory to 256 MB, make it auto-login, enable SSH.
2. Copy =build= directory to Raspberry and run =build.sh= it as root.
   
* Get Libraries for Qt Installation
2. Get libraries and sysroot from Raspbian to host by running =sync-from-pi-to-host.sh=.
3. Correct relative links by running =sysroot-relativelinks.py $SYSROOT=.
   
* Make and Deploy Qt
When qt-source is checked out, run the following to deploy qt to pi (from utils).

1. init-repository-before-configure.sh
2. configure-qt-before-make.sh
3. make -j4 (in qt-source)
4. make install (in qt-source)
5. sync-from-host-to-pi.sh

* Troubleshooting
Sometimes checking out the stable branch helps, in qt-source run =qt5_tool -p --Branch stable=.
