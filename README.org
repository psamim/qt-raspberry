1. Download Raspbian and follow the above guide to install needed packages.
1. Get libraries and sysroot from Raspbian to host by running =sync-from-pi-to-host.sh=.
2. Correct relative links by running =sysroot-relativelinks.py $SYSROOT=.

Sometimes checking out the stable branch helps, in qt-source run =qt5_tool -p --Branch stable=.

1. init-repository-before-configure.sh
2. configure-qt-before-make.sh
3. make -j4 (in qt-source)
4. make install (in qt-source)
